# Boom Bikes Demand Prediction
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To regain market stability, the company plans to forecast the demand for shared bikes once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers. They seek to identify key factors that influence bike demand and how accurately these variables can predict future usage. BoomBikes has collected extensive data on daily bike demand across the American market and enlisted a consulting firm to analyze these factors to develop a data-driven strategy for business recovery.

**The company wants to know:**

 - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
 - How well those variables describe the bike demands based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

**Business Goals**
The company needs to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
